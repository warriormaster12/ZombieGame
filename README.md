## Project management 
This is going to be handled in Github using built-in tools such as issues for tracking unimplemented features, bugs etc. On top of that, the project is going to use Github milestones for tracking the priority of resolving issues. 
Milestones are weekly based and the issues inside of them should be resolved inside the milestone unless it takes more or less time, in which case they can be moved between milestones.

## Coding conventions 
pascal case variables and functions 
camel case classes and structs

member variables are going to be marked with ```m_```
example: ```m_game_object```
